# Building-Digital-Systems
The project we made during the course sperated to small projects that are building each other.
The idea of the project is building a computer from the electronics to the operating system, and building a game that can be played on it.

Project 01
----------
Bulding basic combinational logic gates using made-up HDL language named HQL.

Project 02
----------
Building more complax combinational logic gates.

Project 03
----------
Building sequential logic gates.

Project 4
---------
Leraning the assambler by building some functions.

Project 05
----------
Building the main parts of the computer: CPU, Memory and the Computer itself.

Project 06
----------
Building a parser from the assembler language to the binary commands.

Projects 07 + 08
----------------
Building a translator from the vm language to the assembler commands.

Project 09
----------
Building a game using java like language (Jack).

Project 10 + 11
---------------
Building a compiler from the Jack language to the vm language.

Project 12
----------
Building the operating systems functions.
